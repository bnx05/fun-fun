## What's inside

### Arcade

This folder contains my stab at creating a small game using the Python [arcade library](https://github.com/pvcraven/arcade). 

#### The game

`Hungry Cat` is a 2D game, with the simple aim of collecting as many fish as possible, while avoiding the missiles that try to destroy the hungry feline.

#### How to run

Install prerequisites first by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`. Ideally, this should be done inside a virtual environment.

Run the game by calling `python hungry_cat.py`

#### Notes

- This game has been tested on Python3.7 version only. Other versions are untested, so there's no guarantee that it will run correctly.

#### To Do List

- Replace images. The cat pic isn't mine :(
- Add a database to store the scores.
- Display current score and high score in game over view.
- Add more enemies.
- Change background for all views.

#### Inspiration

Saw this primer at [RealPython](https://realpython.com/arcade-python-game-framework/); this game is inspired by the article. Also took inspiration from the [official docs](https://arcade.academy/examples/index.html).
